// Block decomposition of 2D rectangular uniform matrix

/*
Suppose there is a 2D rectangular uniform mesh, which has M points in the
x-direction and N points in the y-direction (MxN dim); Please describe in detail how to
carry out a checkerboard block decomposition of the mesh into S Ã—T blocks,
as evenly as possible. Note that M may not be divisible by S, and N may
not be divisible by T
